# CICS OSGi Java database connectivity (JDBC) application

This sample demonstrates an OSGi JDBC application integrated with IBM CICS that can be deployed to a CICS OSGi JVM server.

The application makes use of the employee sample table supplied with Db2 for z/OS. The application allows you to display employee information from the table EMP. The sample also provides a set of Gradle and Maven build files for use either in Eclipse or standalone build environments.
