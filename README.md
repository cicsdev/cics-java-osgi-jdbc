# cics-java-osgi-jdbc
This sample demonstrates an OSGi JDBC application integrated with IBM CICS that can be deployed to a CICS OSGi JVM server.

The application makes use of the employee sample table supplied with Db2 for z/OS. The application allows you to display employee information from the table EMP. The sample also provides a set of Gradle and Maven build files for use either in Eclipse or standalone build environments.

## Requirements
* CICS TS V6.1 or later
* A connected CICS DB2CONN resource. For more information, see [DB2CONN](#cics-db2conn-connection)
* An OSGi JVM server
* Java SE 1.8 or later on the workstation
* IBM Db2 V11 or later on z/OS
* An Eclipse development environment on the workstation (optional)
* Either Gradle or Apache Maven on the workstation (optional if using Wrappers)

## Building
You can build the sample using an IDE of your choice, or you can build it from the command line. For both approaches, using the supplied Gradle or Maven wrappers will give a consistent version of build tooling.

For an IDE, taking Eclipse as an example, the plug-ins for Gradle *buildship* and Maven *m2e* will integrate with the "Run As..." capability, allowing you to specify whether you want to build the project with a Wrapper, or a specific version of your chosen build tool.

**Note:** If you import the project to your IDE, you might experience local project compile errors. To resolve these errors you should run a tooling refresh on that project.
For example, in Eclipse: 
* for Gradle, right-click on "Project", select "Gradle -> Refresh Gradle Project", 
* for Maven, right-click on "Project", select "Maven -> Update Project...".

> Tip: *In Eclipse, Gradle (buildship) is able to fully refresh and resolve the local classpath even if the project was previously updated by Maven. However, Maven (m2e) does not currently reciprocate that capability. If you previously refreshed the project with Gradle, you'll need to manually remove the 'Project Dependencies' entry on the Java build-path of your Project Properties to avoid duplication errors when performing a Maven Project Update.*

### Building with Gradle

A JAR file is created inside the `cics-java-osgi-jdbc-app/build/libs` directory and a CICS bundle ZIP file inside the `cics-java-osgi-jdbc-bundle/build/distributions` directory.

If using the CICS bundle ZIP, the CICS JVM server name should be modified in the  `cics.jvmserver` property in the gradle build [cics-java-osgi-jdbc-bundle/build.gradle](cics-java-osgi-jdbc-bundle/build.gradle) to match the required CICS JVMSERVER resource name, or alternatively can be set on the command line.

**Gradle Wrapper (Linux/Mac):**
```shell
./gradlew clean build
```
**Gradle Wrapper (Windows):**
```shell
gradle.bat clean build
```
**Gradle (command-line):**
```shell
gradle clean build
```
**Gradle (command-line & setting jvmserver):**
```shell
gradle clean build -Pcics.jvmserver=MYJVM
```

### Building with Apache Maven

A JAR file is created inside the `cics-java-osgi-jdbc-app/target` directory and a CICS bundle ZIP file inside the `cics-java-osgi-jdbc-bundle/target` directory.

If building a CICS bundle ZIP the CICS bundle plugin bundle-war goal is driven using the maven verify phase. The CICS JVM server name should be modified in the `<cics.jvmserver>` property in the [`pom.xml`](pom.xml) to match the required CICS JVMSERVER resource name, or alternatively can be set on the command line.

**Maven Wrapper (Linux/Mac):**
```shell
./mvnw clean verify
```
**Maven Wrapper (Windows):**
```shell
mvnw.cmd clean verify
```
**Maven (command-line):**
```shell
mvn clean verify
```
**Maven (command-line & setting jvmserver):**
```shell
mvn clean verify -Dcics.jvmserver=MYJVM
```

## Deploying to CICS
### Configure CICS JCL
To allow your CICS region to connect to DB2, we need to add some configuration to the JCL.

```
//  SET DB2=V12                           - DB2 Version
...
<variables>
...
DB2CONN=YES

//STEPLIB
...
//         DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS2.DB2.&DB2..SDSNLOAD
//         DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS2.DB2.&DB2..SDSNLOD2
//         DD DISP=SHR,DSN=DSN&DB2.P2.RUNLIB.LOAD
```

### Configure the JVM Profile
Configure the JVM profile of the OSGi JVM server to include the Db2 driver JARs in the `OSGI_BUNDLES` environment variable and the Db2 library in the `LIBRARY_SUFFIX` environment variable.

> Note: The same of your JVM profile MUST be DFHOSGI

```
DB2_PATH=/usr/lpp/db2v12
OSGI_BUNDLES=&DB2_PATH;/jdbc/classes/db2jcc4.jar,\
             &DB2_PATH;/jdbc/classes/db2jcc_license_cisuz.jar
LIBPATH_SUFFIX=&DB2_PATH;/jdbc/lib
```
>Note: This example is using db2v12, this version must be consistent to the version set in your JCL.

As an example, see the provided [JVM profile template](etc/jvmprofiles/DFHOSGI.jvmprofile). If necessary, restart the JVM server.

---

### CICS DB2CONN Connection

Ensure a CICS DB2CONN is installed and connected. 

```
CEDA DEFINE DB2CONN(JODBCONN) GROUP(CDEVJODB)
```
```
CEDA INSTALL DB2CONN(CDEVJODB) GROUP(CDEVJODB)
```

### CICS DB2CONN Connection with CICS Explorer
1. Definitions > Db2 > Db2 Connection Definitions
2. Right-click > New...
3. Fill in the Name and Group with `CDEVJODB`
4. Right-click and install the new definition
5. Ensure it is CONNECTED

> Note: The DB2ID differs between DB2 versions and the system you are running your CICS region on. For example, DB2V12 on plex2c, the DB2ID would be DK2C.

---

### Deploying using command line tools
1. Upload the built CICS bundle ZIP file from your *projects/cics-java-osgi-jdbc-bundle/target* or *projects/cics-java-osgi-jdbc-bundle/build/distributions* directory to z/FS on the host system (e.g. FTP).
2. Connect to USS on the host system (e.g. SSH).
3. Create the bundle directory for the project.
4. Move the CICS bundle ZIP file into the bundle directory.
5. Change directory into the bundle directoy.
6. Extract the CICS bundle ZIP file. This can be done using the `jar` command. For example:
   ```shell
   jar xf file.zip
   ```

### Deploying using CICS Explorer
1. Copy and paste the built JAR from your *projects/cics-java-osgi-jdbc-app/target* or *projects/cics-java-osgi-jdbc-app/build/libs* directory into a Eclipse CICS bundle project.
2. Create a new OSGi bundlepart that references the JAR file. 
3. Deploy the CICS bundle project from CICS Explorer using the **Export Bundle Project to z/OS UNIX File System** wizard.

### Deploying using CICS Explorer and CICS Bundle ZIP
1. Connect to USS on the host system (e.g. SSH).
2. Create the bundle directory for the project.
3. Copy & paste the built CICS bundle ZIP file from your *projects/cics-java-osgi-jdbc-bundle/target* or *projects/cics-java-osgi-jdbc-bundle/build/distributions* directory to z/FS on the host system into the bundle directory.
4. Extract ther ZIP by right-clicking on the ZIP file > User Action > unjar...
5. Refresh the bundle directory

---

### Installing the bundle
1. Create a new bundle definition, setting the bundle directory to the deployed bundle directory:
   ```
   BUNDLE(CDEVJODB) GROUP(CDEVJODB) BUNDLEDIR(/path/to/bundle/directory)
   ```
2. Install the bundle

### Installing the bundle with CICS Explorer
1. Definitions > Bundle Definitions
2. Right-click > New...
3. Fill in the Bundle and Group names as `CDEVJODB`
4. Fill in the Bundle Directory to point to the directory you expanded the ZIP
5. Install the bundle
